----

Terraclient is a new-age Terraria client built for Terraria 1.4.2.2. As of now, it is a heavy work-in-progress and not ready for public distribution; however, anyone is capable of building it themselves.

## Features

(Note that this list is ever-expanding and not always complete)
- Toggle Godmode.
- Toggle the bypass for journey/classic limitations.
- Toggle Fullbright.
  - \+ also offers options to improve preformance.
- Teleport to anywhere on the world map with the click of a button.
- Spoof Journey mode.
  - (Gives your character access to all Journey mode features like research, even on servers. This does not make the server register you has a Journey mode character, though.)
- Toggle multiplayer nameplate ESP.
  - Option to display more info as well.
    - Displays yourself as well.
- Can force the removal of wide-screen scaling and main-menu UI scaling limits.
- Can force the removal of PvP/team-switching cooldown removal.
- Can cycle character difficulty in the character selection screen, and save it to the player file.
- Can unlock all Journey mode items in the item spawning UI (requires rejoining the world/server).
- Can temporarily unlock all bestiary entries- and allow you to spawn NPCs from that menu.
  - Also shows a list of buff immunities for enemies that have any.
- The ability to regenerate your UUID from the main menu, with a handy button.
- Incredibly beefy chat command system (W.I.P.).
- Toggle an infinite chest reach cheat.
- Player bank (i.e. piggy, safe, etc.) viewing/cycling from the inventory. Requires the aforementioned infinite chest reach cheat to work.
- Unlocks and unbans deprecated items, including the First Fractal.
- Helpful menu changes.
- Torch exploit cheat: use the command to spawn a torch that players with vanilla clients can't load, locking servers.
  - *And* Torch exploit cheat immunity, in case anyone else wants to get you back.
